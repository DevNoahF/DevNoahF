- ⚡ Fun fact: We have about 7 octillion atoms in our body.
- Each atom, the basic unit of matter, contains a massive, dense nucleus surrounded by electrons.
- It turns out that the nucleus is quite small relative to the size of the atom.
- For example, if the nucleus were the size of a tennis ball, the electrons would be 500 meters away from it!
- Thus, most of an atom is empty space.
  
- 🖋️ One sentence: Fear is the father of morality.
